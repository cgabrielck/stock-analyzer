**Live application / 線上版本:** [stock-analyzergit-ijue4vuwb7kuvizn62fema.streamlit.app](https://stock-analyzergit-ijue4vuwb7kuvizn62fema.streamlit.app/)

Quality grades, architecture decisions, and the phased enhancement plan are tracked in [docs/QUALITY_ROADMAP.md](docs/QUALITY_ROADMAP.md).

## What's New / 近期更新

- **Chart redesigned** — Clean simple/detail mode. Default view focuses on ~90 recent daily candles with natural scroll, pinch-zoom, and drag panning. No cluttered toolbar — just the price, volume, trend line, entry zone, stop, and target 1. Toggle detail mode for SMA/EMA, Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD, Fibonacci, and Double Top/Bottom patterns with plain-language indicator explanations.
- **Chart pattern overlays** — Double Top / Double Bottom detection with look-ahead bias prevention, Fibonacci retracement levels, and TradingView Pine Script v6 export for independent verification.
- **Price alert monitoring** — Directional crossing state machine with confirmation bars, re-arm logic (0.5% away from level), stale quote rejection, and duplicate-safe events. Standalone background worker (default 60s interval) checks alerts when the browser is closed.
- **Saved Plan versioning** — Immutable Deep Research versions with version history browsing, replacement with explicit invalidation of old alert rules, and on-demand outcome evaluation at 5/20/60 sessions.
- **Full regression suite** — 191 passing tests covering backtesting, portfolio, alerts, patterns, charts, i18n, and database operations.

## What It Does / 系統功能

- Screens a curated universe of **74 liquid US-listed equities** across 14 sectors.
- Separates the universe into **69 Core** and **5 Satellite** stocks.
- Produces up to five recommendations with sector and speculative-stock limits.
- Selects the correct Yahoo quote for pre-market, regular, after-hours, overnight, or closed sessions.
- Blends fundamental, technical, and optional LLM analysis.
- Applies a transparent risk penalty before ranking stocks.
- Detects the global SPY/VIX market regime and adjusts entry thresholds and portfolio exposure.
- Simulates monthly rebalancing with turnover, cash, transaction costs, and no-look-ahead score calibration.
- Builds a portfolio with capped position weights, stop losses, P&L, correlation alerts, and a local trade journal.
- Provides English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese interfaces.

## Current Decision Logic / 目前決策邏輯

### 1. Investable Universe / 可投資股票池

The built-in universe contains 74 stocks:

| Constraint | Current rule |
|---|---:|
| Core stocks | 69 |
| Satellite stocks | 5 |
| Maximum recommendations | 5 |
| Maximum per sector | 2 |
| Maximum Satellite positions | 1 |
| Minimum Satellite selection score | 65 |

Core stocks emphasize liquidity, operating history, and diversified sector exposure. Satellite stocks currently include higher-risk EV and space names. User-added custom tickers are treated conservatively as Satellite stocks.

內建股票池以大型、高流動性股票為核心，並保留少量高風險主題股票。自訂股票預設視為 Satellite，避免未知標的無限制進入投資組合。

### 2. Fundamental Score / 基本面評分

Available metrics are normalized to a 0–100 score. Missing metrics do not automatically become zero; the available weights are renormalized, while live recommendations require at least four usable metrics.

| Metric | Relative weight |
|---|---:|
| Revenue growth | 25% |
| EPS growth | 20% |
| PEG ratio | 15% |
| Profit margin | 10% |
| ROE | 10% |
| Debt-to-equity | 5% |

Yahoo `debtToEquity` is normalized from percentage points to a ratio before scoring. For example, Yahoo `150` becomes `1.5x`.

### 3. Technical Score / 技術評分

Technical analysis uses approximately six months of adjusted OHLCV data:

- RSI(14)
- MACD and signal histogram
- SMA20 / SMA50 trend
- Bollinger Bands
- ATR(14)
- 10-day versus 50-day volume ratio

When technical data is available:

```text
base_score = 70% fundamental_score + 30% technical_score
```

### 4. Optional LLM Blend / 選用 LLM 混合評分

The highest-ranked candidates can be analyzed by any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The default influence is 20% and is adjustable in the sidebar.

```text
model_score = quant_score × (1 - llm_weight) + llm_score × llm_weight
```

The LLM is an assistant, not the primary decision engine. The app remains fully usable without an API key.

### 5. Risk-Adjusted Selection / 風險調整選股

Risk is calculated from the latest 126 valid adjusted prices, with at least 60 return observations required.

| Risk tier | Trigger | Score penalty |
|---|---|---:|
| Low | Volatility <25% and drawdown <25% | 0 |
| Medium | Volatility ≥25% or drawdown ≥25% | −5 |
| High | Volatility ≥45% or drawdown ≥50% | −10 |

```text
risk_adjusted_score = model_score - risk_penalty
```

Selection, backtest calibration, and calibrated Kelly sizing use `risk_adjusted_score`. The original model score remains visible for auditability. Missing risk data is neutral and clearly labeled instead of silently rejecting the stock.

Additional displayed risk metrics include:

- Historical VaR 95%
- Annualized volatility and return
- Maximum drawdown
- Sharpe and Sortino ratios
- Beta versus SPY

### 6. Global Market Regime / 全局市場狀態

The regime engine uses one year of SPY and VIX data. SPY trend is classified with SMA50 and SMA200; VIX ≥25 overrides the trend as high volatility.

| Regime | Entry threshold | Fill threshold | Target portfolio exposure |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Bull | 60 | 50 | 90% |
| Neutral | 65 | 55 | 70% |
| Bear | 72 | 65 | 40% |
| High volatility | 75 | 68 | 40% |

The same regime rules are applied in live recommendations and historical backtests. Defensive regimes raise the quality threshold and retain more cash rather than forcing five positions.

### 7. Active-Session Price Selection / 即時交易時段價格

Price selection follows Yahoo's current `marketState` rather than blindly preferring any populated quote field:

| Yahoo state | Preferred price |
|---|---|
| `PRE` / `PREPRE` | Fresh pre-market quote |
| `REGULAR` | Regular-market quote |
| `POST` / `POSTPOST` | Fresh after-hours quote |
| `CLOSED` | Newest completed-session quote, labeled closed |

If the expected session quote is unavailable or stale, the app requests an explicit one-minute, extended-hours bar. It finally falls back to the regular close and marks the result `STALE`. The UI displays the session, quote source, quote timestamp, and freshness status.

### 8. Portfolio Construction / 投資組合建構

- Maximum position weight: 25%
- Maximum exposure: regime-dependent, between 40% and 90%
- Default fallback: equal weight with retained cash
- Calibrated Kelly: enabled only when a valid walk-forward model exists
- Calibration expiry: 180 days
- Default stop loss: 10%, adjusted by Beta and capped at 25%
- Correlation warning: positive correlation `ρ ≥ 0.80`

The system no longer treats `score / 100` as a win probability. If a valid calibration model is unavailable, it safely uses capped equal weights.

## Walk-Forward Backtesting / Walk-Forward 回測

The backtest uses only information available at each monthly rebalance date:

- Six-month technical warm-up before the requested start date
- Adjusted stock and SPY prices
- Quarterly fundamentals with a conservative 60-day filing lag
- Monthly rebalancing
- Shared live/backtest selection rules
- Historical SPY/VIX regime classification
- Equal-weight or expanding calibrated-Kelly sizing
- Drift-aware turnover and configurable transaction costs
- Cash retained according to regime exposure
- Months with missing selected-stock exit prices are excluded instead of silently reallocating weights
- Coverage diagnostics for prices, technicals, fundamentals, and exits

Calibration uses completed stock-month outcomes only:

```text
At rebalance T:
1. Add outcomes completed before T
2. Fit/update score probability bins
3. Score and size positions at T
4. Queue T outcomes for the next rebalance
```

Calibration models are versioned and written atomically. A model is not allowed into live sizing when universe quality, technical coverage, sample size, or exit-price checks fail.

### Important Backtest Limitation / 重要限制

If `data/historical_universe.json` is absent, historical tests use today's universe and therefore contain survivorship bias. The UI displays this warning, and such a backtest is not permitted to generate a live sizing model.

Yahoo generally exposes only limited quarterly history. Fundamental coverage may therefore be lower in early backtest periods. Coverage is displayed instead of being hidden.

## Data Sources / 資料來源

| Source | Primary use |
|---|---|
| Yahoo Finance / `yfinance` | Session quotes, adjusted OHLCV, fundamentals, benchmark, VIX, options, news |
| Yahoo chart and quote-summary APIs | HTTP fallback pricing and fundamentals |
| Sina Finance | Cloud fallback quotes and news |
| East Money / AKShare | China-accessible fundamental fallback |
| SEC EDGAR | Latest 10-K/10-Q filing context |
| Local seed data | Offline fallback for the original universe subset |
| OpenAI-compatible API | Optional LLM scoring and narrative analysis |

Cached market information uses a five-minute TTL. Running analysis with force refresh bypasses application caches, but upstream providers may still be delayed.

## Professional UI / 專業交易介面

The Streamlit interface uses a custom dark institutional-terminal design:

- Responsive desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts
- Core/Satellite universe labels
- Market-regime and target-exposure banner
- Risk-adjusted recommendation cards
- Model score, risk penalty, and selection-score breakdown
- Dark Plotly technical and backtest charts
- Portfolio risk overview, correlation alerts, stop-loss alerts, and trade journal
- English, 简体中文, and 繁體中文 localization

## Tech Stack / 技術棧

- **Python 3.12**
- **Streamlit** for the web application
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for time-series and quantitative calculations
- **yfinance** for Yahoo market and fundamental data
- **AKShare**, **Requests**, and **BeautifulSoup4** for fallback data and parsing
- **Plotly** and **Altair** for interactive visualization
- **OpenAI Python SDK** for optional OpenAI-compatible LLM providers
- **pytest** for regression testing
- Thread pools for bounded parallel quote, technical, and backtest data retrieval
- JSON-based local persistence for cache, portfolio state, trade journal, and calibration models

## Quick Start / 快速開始

Python 3.12 is recommended.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cgabrielck/stock-analyzer.git
cd stock-analyzer

python3.12 -m venv .venv312
source .venv312/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run backend/app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

CLI mode:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=backend python backend/run_agent.py
```

## API Configuration / API 設定

LLM analysis is optional. Configure an OpenAI-compatible provider in `.env` locally or Streamlit Secrets in cloud deployment:

```env
LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/v1
LLM_MODEL=deepseek-chat
LLM_REASONING_MODEL=deepseek-reasoner
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your-alpha-vantage-key
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-server-side-service-role-key
```

`deepseek-chat` handles batch scoring and structured JSON tasks. `deepseek-reasoner` is reserved for on-demand single-stock strategy analysis, where deeper reasoning is worth the additional latency and cost.

Do not commit `.env` or API keys. The repository ignores `.env`, virtual environments, caches, portfolio state, and trade journals.

Alpha Vantage is optional. When configured, it supplies company overview, income statements, balance sheets, cash flow, earnings, and adjusted daily-price fallback data. Fundamentals are cached for 24 hours to protect provider quotas. Yahoo remains responsible for session-aware pre-market, regular-market, and after-hours quotes. If Alpha Vantage is unavailable or rate-limited, the existing Yahoo/China/seed fallback chain continues automatically.

## Testing / 測試

```bash
./.venv312/bin/pytest -q
```

Current verified result:

```text
191 passed
```

Additional checks:

```bash
./.venv312/bin/python -m compileall -q backend tests
git diff --check
```

## Streamlit Cloud Deployment / 雲端部署

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Connect it at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io).
3. Set the entry point to `backend/app.py`.
4. Open the app's **Settings → Secrets** and add root-level TOML values:

```toml
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = "replace-with-a-new-key"
LLM_API_KEY = "your-llm-key"
LLM_BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com/v1"
LLM_MODEL = "deepseek-chat"
LLM_REASONING_MODEL = "deepseek-reasoner"
SUPABASE_URL = "https://your-project.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = "your-server-side-service-role-key"
```

Only `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` is required for Alpha Vantage. The LLM and Supabase values remain optional. Do not add quotes around the variable name, do not paste `.env` syntax such as `KEY=value` into the TOML editor, and never commit `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.
5. Save Secrets, reboot the app if Streamlit does not restart it automatically, and set app visibility as required.

Every push to `main` triggers a Streamlit Cloud redeploy.

## Privacy and Persistence / 隱私與持久化

`data/portfolio_state.json` and `data/trade_journal.json` are local runtime files and are intentionally excluded from Git. On ephemeral cloud hosting, local file changes may be lost after a restart or redeploy. Use an external database before relying on the journal as a permanent multi-user ledger.

### Optional Accounts and Favorites

Guest analysis works without account configuration. To enable persistent username/PIN accounts, Favorites, and preferences:

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run `backend/persistence/migrations/001_accounts.sql`, `002_saved_plan_alerts.sql`, `003_saved_plan_outcomes.sql`, `004_fix_saved_plan_rpc.sql`, then `005_alert_monitoring.sql`, in the Supabase SQL editor.
3. Add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to server-side Streamlit Secrets.
4. Restart the app.

The service-role key bypasses row-level security and must never be exposed in browser code or committed to Git. The account adapter is called only by Streamlit server-side Python. Direct access through Supabase's public anon/authenticated roles remains denied because the migration enables RLS without public policies.

The current product requirement stores PIN values as plaintext and allows any PIN format. A database operator or database leak can therefore reveal every PIN. Use unique PINs that are not reused for other services. One-way PIN hashing is strongly recommended before production use.

Authenticated users can save deterministic Deep Research plans, compare a re-analysis with the active plan, explicitly replace it with an immutable new version, review version history, and confirm direction-aware price alert rules. Replacing a plan invalidates its prior alert rules and requires explicit reconfirmation against the new levels.

### Price alert worker

Price alert rules are monitored outside Streamlit so checks continue after the browser closes. Deploy a long-running worker on Railway, Render, or another process host with the same `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, then run:

```bash
python backend/alert_worker.py
```

The default interval is one minute. Set `ALERT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to change it. The worker rejects stale Yahoo quotes, triggers only on directional crossings or entry-zone transitions, re-arms after price moves away from the level, and stores duplicate-safe events in the signed-in user's in-app alert inbox. This is periodic/delayed monitoring, not exchange-grade real-time market data.

Deep Research also includes bounded SEC filing evidence with direct EDGAR citations. Saved-plan outcome journals can be evaluated on demand at 5, 20, and 60 completed trading sessions using raw daily OHLC and exact-date SPY comparison. Outcome observations are educational research records, not brokerage fills. The model portfolio reports cash-aware covariance volatility, historical VaR, coverage, and transparent -10%/-20% equity stress scenarios.
